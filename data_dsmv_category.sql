INSERT INTO `dsmv_category` VALUES (1,'Neurodevelopmental Disorders',NULL,'The neurodevelopmental disorders are a group of conditions with onset in the developmental period. The disorders typically manifest early in development, often before the child enters grade school, and are characterized by developmental deficits that produce impairments of personal, social, academic, or occupational functioning. The range of developmental deficits varies from very specific limitations of learning or control of executive functions to global impairments of social skills or intelligence. The neurodevelopmental disorders frequently co-occur; for example, individuals with autism spectrum disorder often have intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder), and many children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also have a specific learning disorder. For some disorders, the clinical presentation includes symptoms of excess as well as deficits and delays in achieving expected milestones. For example, autism spectrum disorder is diagnosed only when the characteristic deficits of social communication are accompanied by excessively repetitive behaviors, restricted interests, and insistence on sameness.'),(2,'Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders',NULL,'Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders include schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders, and schizotypal (personality) disorder. They are defined by abnormalities in one or more of the following five domains: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking (speech), grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior (including catatonia), and negative symptoms.'),(3,'Bipolar and Related Disorders',NULL,'Bipolar and related disorders are separated from the depressive disorders in DSM-5 and placed between the chapters on schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders and depressive disorders in recognition of their place as a bridge between the two diagnostic classes in terms of symptomatology, family history, and genetics. The diagnoses included in this chapter are bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, cyclothymic disorder, substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder, bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition, other specified bipolar and related disorder, and unspecified bipolar and related disorder'),(4,'Depressive Disorders',NULL,'Depressive disorders include disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, major depressive disorder (including major depressive episode), persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), premenstrual dysphoric disorder, substance/medication-induced depressive disorder, depressive disorder due to another medical condition, other specified depressive disorder, and unspecified depressive disorder. Unlike in DSM-IV, this chapter “Depressive Disorders” has been separated from the previous chapter “Bipolar and Related Disorders.” The common feature of all of these disorders is the presence of sad, empty, or irritable mood, accompanied by somatic and cognitive changes that significantly affect the individual’s capacity to function. What differs among them are issues of duration, timing, or presumed etiology.'),(5,'Anxiety Disorders',NULL,'Anxiety disorders include disorders that share features of excessive fear and anxiety and related behavioral disturbances. Fear is the emotional response to real or perceived imminent threat, whereas anxiety is anticipation of future threat. Obviously, these two states overlap, but they also differ, with fear more often associated with surges of autonomic arousal necessary for fight or flight, thoughts of immediate danger, and escape behaviors, and anxiety more often associated with muscle tension and vigilance in preparation for future danger and cautious or avoidant behaviors. Sometimes the level of fear or anxiety is reduced by pervasive avoidance behaviors. Panic attacks feature prominently within the anxiety disorders as a particular type of fear response. Panic attacks are not limited to anxiety disorders but rather can be seen in other mental disorders as well. The anxiety disorders differ from one another in the types of objects or situations that induce fear, anxiety, or avoidance behavior, and the associated cognitive ideation. Thus, while the anxiety disorders tend to be highly comorbid with each other, they can be differentiated by close examination of the types of situations that are feared or avoided and the content of the associated thoughts or beliefs.'),(6,'Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders',NULL,'Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders include obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder, trichotillomania (hairpulling disorder), excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition, and other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder and unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (e.g., body-focused repetitive behavior disorder, obsessional jealousy). OCD is characterized by the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions are recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced as intrusive and unwanted, whereas compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly. Some other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders are also characterized by preoccupations and by repetitive behaviors or mental acts in response to the preoccupations. Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders are characterized primarily by recurrent body-focused repetitive behaviors (e.g., hair pulling, skin picking) and repeated attempts to decrease or stop the behaviors'),(7,'Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders',NULL,'Trauma- and stressor-related disorders include disorders in which exposure to a traumatic or stressful event is listed explicitly as a diagnostic criterion. These include reactive attachment disorder, disinhibited social engagement disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder, and adjustment disorders'),(8,'Dissociative Disorders',NULL,'Dissociative disorders are characterized by a disruption of and/or discontinuity in the normal integration of consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, motor control, and behavior. Dissociative symptoms can potentially disrupt every area of psychological functioning. This chapter includes dissociative identity disorder, dissociative amnesia, depersonalization/derealization disorder, other specified dissociative disorder, and unspecified dissociative disorder. Dissociative symptoms are experienced as a) unbidden intrusions into awareness and behavior, with accompanying losses of continuity in subjective experience (i.e., ‘‘positive’’ dissociative symptoms such as fragmentation of identity, depersonalization, and derealization) and/or b) inability to access information or to control mental functions that normally are readily amenable to access or control (i.e., “negative’’ dissociative symptoms such as amnesia). The dissociative disorders are frequently found in the aftermath of trauma, and many of the symptoms, including embarrassment and confusion about the symptoms or a desire to hide them, are influenced by the proximity to trauma.'),(9,'Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders',NULL,'Somatic symptom disorder and other disorders with prominent somatic symptoms constitute a new category in DSM-5 called somatic symptom and related disorders. This chapter includes the diagnoses of somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder), psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, factitious disorder, other specified somatic symptom and related disorder, and unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder. All of the disorders in this chapter share a common feature: the prominence of somatic symptoms associated with significant distress and impairment. I'),(10,'Feeding and Eating Disorders',NULL,'Feeding and eating disorders are characterized by a persistent disturbance of eating or eating-related behavior that results in the altered consumption or absorption of food and that significantly impairs physical health or psychosocial functioning. Diagnostic criteria are provided for pica, rumination disorder, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder.'),(11,'Elimination Disorders',NULL,'Elimination disorders all involve the inappropriate elimination of urine or feces and are usually first diagnosed in childhood or adolescence'),(12,'Sleep-Wake Disorders',NULL,'Sleep-wake disorders encompass 10 disorders or disorder groups: insomnia disorder, hypersomnolence disorder, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep arousal disorders, nightmare disorder, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, and substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. Individuals with these disorders typically present with sleep-wake complaints of dissatisfaction regarding the quality, timing, and amount of sleep. Resulting daytime distress and impairment are core features shared by all of these sleep-wake disorders.'),(13,'Sexual Dysfunctions',NULL,'Sexual dysfunctions include delayed ejaculation, erectile disorder, female orgasmic disorder, female sexual interest/arousal disorder, genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder, male hypoactive sexual desire disorder, premature (early) ejaculation, substance/medicationinduced sexual dysfunction, other specified sexual dysfunction, and unspecified sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunctions are a heterogeneous group of disorders that are typically characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in a person’s ability to respond sexually or to experience sexual pleasure. An individual may have several sexual dysfunctions at the same time. In such cases, all of the dysfunctions should be diagnosed.'),(14,'Gender Dysphoria',NULL,'Gender dysphoria refers to the distress that may accompany the incongruence between one’s experienced or expressed gender and one’s assigned gender. Although not all individuals will experience distress as a result of such incongruence, many are distressed if the desired physical interventions by means of hormones and/or surgery are not available.'),(15,'Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders',NULL,'Disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders include conditions involving problems in the self-control of emotions and behaviors. While other disorders in DSM5 may also involve problems in emotional and/or behavioral regulation, the disorders in this chapter are unique in that these problems are manifested in behaviors that violate the rights of others (e.g., aggression, destruction of property) and/or that bring the individual into significant conflict with societal norms or authority figures. The underlying causes of the problems in the self-control of emotions and behaviors can vary greatly across the disorders in this chapter and among individuals within a given diagnostic category'),(16,'Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders',NULL,'The substance-related disorders encompass 10 separate classes of drugs: alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; hallucinogens (with separate categories for phencyclidine [or similarly acting arylcyclohexylamines] and other hallucinogens); inhalants; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics; stimulants (amphetamine-type substances, cocaine, and other stimulants); tobacco; and other (or unknown) substances. These 10 classes are not fully distinct. All drugs that are taken in excess have in common direct activation of the brain reward system, which is involved in the reinforcement of behaviors and the production of memories. They produce such an intense activation of the reward system that normal activities may be neglected. Instead of achieving reward system activation through adaptive behaviors, drugs of abuse directly activate the reward pathways. The pharmacological mechanisms by which each class of drugs produces reward are different, but the drugs typically activate the system and produce feelings of pleasure, often referred to as a “high.” Furthermore, individuals with lower levels of self-control, which may reflect impairments of brain inhibitory mechanisms, may be particularly predisposed to develop substance use disorders, suggesting that the roots of substance use disorders for some persons can be seen in behaviors long before the onset of actual substance use itself. In addition to the substance-related disorders, this chapter also includes gambling disorder, reflecting evidence that gambling behaviors activate reward systems similar to those activated by drugs of abuse and produce some behavioral symptoms that appear comparable to those produced by the substance use disorders'),(17,'Neurocognitive Disorders',NULL,'The NCD category encompasses the group of disorders in which the primary clinical deficit is in cognitive function, and that are acquired rather than developmental. Although cognitive deficits are present in many if not all mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorders), only disorders whose core features are cognitive are included in the NCD category. The NCDs are those in which impaired cognition has not been present since birth or very early life, and thus represents a decline from a previously attained level of functioning.'),(18,'Personality Disorders',NULL,'A personality disorder is an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual’s culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads to distress or impairment.'),(19,'Paraphilic Disorders',NULL,'The term paraphilia denotes any intense and persistent sexual interest other than sexual interest in genital stimulation or preparatory fondling with phenotypically normal, physically mature, consenting human partners. In some circumstances, the criteria “intense and persistent” may be difficult to apply, such as in the assessment of persons who are very old or medically ill and who may not have “intense” sexual interests of any kind. In such circumstances, the term paraphilia may be defined as any sexual interest greater than or equal to normophilic sexual interests. There are also specific paraphilias that are generally better described as preferential sexual interests than as intense sexual interests.'),(20,'Other Mental Disorders',NULL,'Four disorders are included in this chapter: other specified mental disorder due to another medical condition; unspecified mental disorder due to another medical condition; other specified mental disorder; and unspecified mental disorder. This residual category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a mental disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any other mental disorder in DSM-5. For other specified and unspecified mental disorders due to another medical condition, it must be established that the disturbance is caused by the physiological effects of another medical condition.'),(21,'Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other Adverse Effects of Medication',NULL,'Although these movement disorders are labeled “medication induced,” it is often difficult to establish the causal relationship between medication exposure and the development of the movement disorder, especially because some of these movement disorders also occur in the absence of medication exposure. The conditions and problems listed in this chapter are not mental disorders'),(22,'Intellectual Disabilities',1,'Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) is a disorder with onset during the developmental period that includes both intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits in conceptual, social, and practical domains.'),(23,'Communication Disorders',1,'Disorders of communication include deficits in language, speech, and communication. Speech is the expressive production of sounds and includes an individual\'s articulation, fluency, voice, and resonance quality. Language includes the form, function, and use of a conventional system of symbols (i.e., spoken words, sign language, written words, pictures) in a rule-governed manner for communication. Communication includes any verbal or nonverbal behavior (whether intentional or unintentional) that influences the behavior, ideas, or attitudes of another individual. Assessments of speech, language and communication abilities must take into account the individual\'s cultural and language context, particularly for individuals growing up in bilingual environments. The standardized measures of language development and of nonverbal intellectual capacity must be relevant for the cultural and linguistic group (i.e., tests developed and standardized for one group may not provide appropriate norms for a different group).'),(24,'Autism Spectrum Disorder',1,'Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities with early developmental onset, causing clinically significant impairment in social, occupational or other important areass of functioning, that are not better explained by another disorder.'),(25,'Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder',1,'A persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development with dix or more criteria from one or both categories, and with several symptoms presenting prior to the age of 12. These symptoms must be present in two or more domains (home, school, etc.) with clear evidence that these symptoms interfere with or reduce the quality of functioning in these domains. These symptoms must not be better explained by another disorder. ADD and ADHD are no longer differentiated between as separate disorders.'),(26,'Specific Learning Disorder',1,'Difficulties learning and using academic skills despite the provision of interventions that target those difficulties, where the affected academic skills are substantially and quantifiably below those expected for the individual’s chronological age, and cause significant interference with academic or occupational performance, or with activities of daily living, as confirmed by individually administered standardized achievement measures and comprehensive clinical assessment. These difficulties begin during school-age years but may not be obvious until sufficiently high demands for achievement occur, exceeding the individual\'s limited capabilities. These difficulties are not better explained by other intellectual, visual or auditory acuity, mental, or neurological disorders.'),(27,'Motor Disorders',1,'Motor disorders are malfunctions of the nervous system that cause involuntary or uncontrollable or actions of the body. These disorders can cause a lack of intended movement or an excess of involuntary movement.'),(28,'Other Neurodevelopmental Disorders',1,'This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a neurodevelopmental disorder that cause impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class'),(29,'Catatonia',2,'Catatonia can occur in the context of several disorders, including neurodevelopmental, psychotic, bipolar, depressive disorders, and other medical conditions (e.g., cerebral folate deficiency, rare autoimmune and paraneoplastic disorders. Catatonia is not treated as an independent class of disorder but is instead recognized as a) catatonia associated with another mental disorder (i.e., a neurodevelopmental, psychotic disorder, a bipolar disorder, a depressive disorder, or other mental disorder), b) catatonic disorder due to another medical condition, or c) unspecified catatonia'),(30,'Breathing-Related Sleep Disorders',12,'Individuals with hypersomnoience and breathing-related sleep disorders may have similar patterns of excessive sleepiness. Breathing- related sleep disorders are suggested by a history of loud snoring, pauses in breathing during sleep, brain injury, or cardiovascular disease and by the presence of obesity, oropharyngeal anatomical abnormalities, hypertension, or heart failure on physical examination. Polysomnographie studies can confirm the presence of apneic events in breathing-related sleep disorder (and their absence in hypersomnolence disorder)'),(31,'Parasomnias',12,'Parasomnias are disorders characterized by abnormal behavioral, experiential, or physiological events occurring in association with sleep, specific sleep stages, or sleep-wake transitions. The most common parasomnias—non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep arousal disorders and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder—represent admixtures of wakefulness and NREM sleep and wakefulness and REM sleep, respective'),(32,'Substance-Related Disorders',16,'The essential feature of a substance use disorder is a cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and  physiological symptoms indicating that the individual continues using the substance despite significant substance-related problems. As seen in an important characteristic of substance use disorders is an underlying change in brain circuits that may persist beyond detoxification, particularly in individuals with severe disorders. The behavioral effects of these brain changes may be exhibited in the repeated relapses and intense drug craving when the individuals are exposed to drug-related stimuli.'),(33,'Alcohol-Related Disorders',32,'A problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, diagnosed as mild, moderate, or severe based on the number of symptoms, out of a possible 11, in the past 12 months. As it progresses in severity, AUD can cause brain changes that make it difficult to stop drinking, but with prolonged abstinence, at least some AUD-induced brain function changes may improve.'),(34,'Caffeine-Related Disorders',32,'While the DSM-V does not have a diagnose for a caffeine-abuse disorder, this section describes many disorders that occur as a result of caffeine misuse.'),(35,'Cannabis-Related Disorders',32,'This section describes cannabis-use disorder, and a variety of disorders that can occur as a result of cannabis use and abuse.'),(36,'Hallucinogen-Related Disorders',32,'This section describes hallucinogen-use disorders, and disorders that occur as a result of abuse of hallucinogens.'),(37,'Inhalant-Related Disorders',32,'This section describes inhalant-use disorder, and a variety of disorders that can occur as a result of the abuse of inhalants'),(38,'Opioid-Related Disorders',32,'This section describes opioid-use disorder, and a variety of disorders that can occur as a result of the abuse of opioids'),(39,'Sedative-, Hypnotic-, or Anxiolytic-Related Disorders',32,'This section describes disorders relating to the abuse of sedatives, hyponotics and anxiolytics, as well as disorders that may occur as a result of the abuse of these drugs'),(40,'Stimulant-Related Disorders',32,'This section describes disorders relating to the abuse of stimulants like cocaine and amphetamines, as well as disorders that may occur as a result of the abuse of these drugs'),(41,'Tobacco-Related Disorders',32,'This section describes disorders relating to the abuse of tobacco and tobacco products, as well as disorders that may occur as a result of the abuse of, and dependency on tobacco'),(42,'Other (or Unknown) Substance–Related Disorders',32,'This section describes disorders relating to the abuse of other (or undisclosed) substances, as well as disorders that may occur as a result of the abuse of, and dependency on the drugs'),(43,'Non-Substance-Related Disorders',16,'This section describes gambling (gaming) disorder'),(44,'Major and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders',17,'This section replaces the DSM-IV section for delirium, dementia, amnestic and other geriatric cognitive disorders'),(45,'Cluster A Personality Disorders',18,'This section describes personality disorders characterized by odd and eccentric behavior that leads to behavioral and social problems'),(46,'Cluster B Personality Disorders',18,'This section describes personality disorders characterized by dramatic, emotional and/or impulsive behavior that leads to behavioral and social problems'),(47,'Cluster C Personality Disorders',18,'This section describes personality disorders that cause long-term feelings of anxiety and insecurity.'),(48,'Other Personality Disorders',18,'This includes disordered personality changes that occur as a result of medications, and presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a personality disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the personality disorders diagnostic class'),(51,'Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention',NULL,'This chapter covers other conditions and problems that may be a focus of clinical attention or that may otherwise affect the diagnosis, course, prognosis, or treatment of a patient\'s mental disorder. These conditions are presented with their corresponding codes from ICD-9-CM (usually V codes) and ICD-IO-CM (usually Z codes). A condition or problem in this chapter may be coded if it is a reason for the current visit or helps to explain the need for a test, procedure, or treatment. Conditions and problems in this chapter may also be included in the medical record as useful information on circumstances that may affect the patient\'s care, regardless of their relevance to the current visit. The conditions and problems listed in this chapter are not mental disorders. Their inclusion in DSM-5 is meant to draw attention to the scope of additional issues that may be encountered in routine clinical practice and to provide a systematic listing that may be useful to clinicians in documenting these issues'),(52,'Relational Problems',51,'Key relationships, especially intimate adult partner relationships and parent/caregiver-child relationships, have a significant impact on the health of the individuals in these relationships. These relationships can be health promoting and protective, neutral, or detrimental to health outcomes. In the extreme, these close relationships can be associated with maltreatment or neglect, which has significant medical and psychological consequences for the affected individual. A relational problem may come to clinical attention either as the reason that the individual seeks health care or as a problem that affects the course, prognosis, or treatment of the individual\'s mental or other medical disorder'),(53,'Abuse and Neglect',51,'Maltreatment by a family member (e.g., caregiver, intimate adult partner) or by a nonrelative can be the area of current clinical focus, or such maltreatment can be an important factor in the assessment and treatment of patients with mental or other medical disorders. Because of the legal implications of abuse and neglect, care should be used in assessing these conditions and assigning these codes. Having a past history of abuse or neglect can influence diagnosis and treatment response in a number of mental disorders, and may also be noted along with the diagnosis.'),(54,'Educational and Occupational Problems',51,''),(55,'Housing and Economic Problems',51,''),(56,'Other Problems Related to the Social Environment',51,''),(57,'Problems Related to Crime or Interaction With the Legal System',51,''),(58,'Other Health Service Encounters for Counseling and Medical Advice',51,''),(59,'Problems Related to Other Psychosocial, Personal, and Environmental Circumstances',51,''),(60,'Other Circumstances of Personal History',51,''),(61,'Problems Related to Family Upbringing',52,''),(62,'Other Problems Related to Primary Support Group',52,''),(63,'Child Maltreatment and Neglect Problems',53,''),(64,'Child Physical Abuse',63,'Child physical abuse is nonaccidental physical injury to a child—ranging from minor bruises to severe fractures or death—occurring as a result of punching, beating, kicking, biting, shaking, throwing, stabbing, choking, hitting (with a hand, stick, strap, or other object), burning, or any other method that is inflicted by a parent, caregiver, or other individual who has responsibility for the child. Such injury is considered abuse regardless of whether the caregiver intended to hurt the child. Physical discipline, such as spanking or paddling, is not considered abuse as long as it is reasonable and causes no bodily injury to the child.'),(65,'Child Sexual Abuse',63,'Child sexual abuse encompasses any sexual act involving a child that is intended to provide sexual gratification to a parent, caregiver, or other individual who has responsibility for the child. Sexual abuse includes activities such as fondling a child\'s genitals, penetration, incest, rape, sodomy, and indecent exposure.
